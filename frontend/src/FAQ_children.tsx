  With the advent of COVID vaccines for children and the recommendations for all children over the age of 5 year to get 2 doses of the COVID vaccine, the CoRiCal team have developed a children’s version of the CoRiCal tool. <br />
  This FAQ sheet outlines some of the questions that parents have asked about the COVID vaccines including the number who experience adverse effects as well as the effectiveness of the COVID vaccines in preventing serious adverse events. <br />
  The information is consistent with that provided by ATAGI and the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS)

    question: "Are children at risk of getting COVID?",
    answer: `Yes
    Everyone, including children, is at risk of getting COVID-19. Studies show that like adults, both children and adolescents can play a role in spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus – the virus that causes COVID-19. Spread between young children or from young children to adults in the household setting is just as common as the spread between adults.
    The Omicron variants of COVID-19 are more transmissible than the ancestral strain and earlier variants and are causing higher number of cases in children compared with the original strain and prior variants, but are not causing more severe disease. Household or close family contact from unvaccinated adults poses the greatest risk of spread to children. Children tend to get mild disease and the majority do not require hospitalisation, but rarely, around 1 in 3,000 children infected with COVID  may develop a post-COVID inflammatory syndrome that affects many organs in their body, called PIMS-TS (also known as MIS-C).

  {
    question: "Which children are most at risk from getting COVID?",
    answer: `Some of the conditions that increase the risk of being hospitalised with COVID-19 in children, compared with healthy children, include (but are not limited to): children with diabetes, congenital heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, neurological diseases, being born premature or being overweight.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Should children get the COVID vaccine?",
    answer: <>
      <ul>
        <li>While COVID is mild in most children, a few can become very ill and suffer long term effects </li>
        <li>Children are more likely to become very ill from COVID if they have a complex or chronic illness like heart disease, diabetes, being born premature or being quite overweight for their age </li>
        <li>The COVID vaccine reduces the likelihood that if a child does get COVID then the disease will be less severe. There is also emerging evidence that the multi-inflammatory syndrome that can occur following COVID is less likely in a child who has had a COVID vaccine. </li>
        <li>Children can spread COVID in their community and especially to member of their family/ household;  vaccinated people are less likely to pass on the virus than unvaccinated people </li>
      </ul>
    </>,
  },
  {
    question: "What are the side effects of the COVID vaccine?",
    answer: `Side effects are not common and include local injection-site pain, redness and swelling. They could also experience a headache or general aches and pains. These usually settle fairly quickly.
              More severe reactions eg myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) are very uncommon and occur much less commonly than myocarditis that occurs after getting COVID. Myocarditis after getting COVID is more severe than the myocarditis that follows a COVID vaccine in children.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Do the COVID vaccines reduce the risk of myocarditis and being admitted to hospital?",
    answer: `The likelihood of developing myocarditis and also being admitted to hospital is far more likely in children who get COVID than and who have not had a COVID vaccine. The best protection is provided by the child having two doses of a COVID. The COVID vaccines also reduce the risk of the multi-inflammatory syndrome that occurs uncommonly in children.`,
